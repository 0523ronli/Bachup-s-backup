## Why
<p>We think that our desktop is quite all the times and its hard to clean it up when its messy,</p>
<p>so we want to make a floating window that can do everything that you can do in your desktop.</p>
<p>Even it is not messy, you can still use it to make your desktop more beautiful and clean.</p>
<p><strong>What's more! You can look at your <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0523ronli/Floating-Desktop/main/assets/breadcar.gif">Desktop Image</a> with no items on it.</strong></p>

## How
Using C# Window Form with base and thats it.

## Features
<p>You can add any item in your desktop into the floating window, and you can do features just like you are in your original desktop.</p>
<p>You can resize the items into different size, change the opactiy, add image at background and even Rainbow mode!</p>
<p>There are even some feature that you can't do in your original desktop, such as a temp folder, that you can easily modify when your desktop is full of files.</p>
